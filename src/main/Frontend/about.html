  <h2>About BC Assist</h2>
  <p>BC-Assist was created by a Bloomfield College IT student worker who identified and dealt with common challenges students faced when navigating the school's resources. The goal of BC-Assist is to provide students with a single, easy-to-navigate platform where they can find all the information they need without having to navigate through the sometimes frustrating MSU website.</p>
  <p>This platform aims to streamline access to important resources like the academic calendar, frequently asked questions, and more, with a focus on making everything easily accessible and helpful.</p>
